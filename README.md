## Development

### Database Migrations
- Run `/upgrade-db` route after updating schema
- Backup database before major changes
- Test migrations on development data first

### Adding New Features
1. Update database schema in `database.py`
2. Create migration function for existing installations
3. Add route handlers in `app.py`
4. Create/update templates as needed
5. Update audit logging for new actions

## Security Considerations

- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Monitor audit logs for suspicious activities
- Use strong passwords for admin accounts
- Keep SendGrid API keys secure and rotate regularly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Errors**: Ensure database is initialized and upgraded
2. **Email Not Sending**: Check SendGrid API key and FROM_EMAIL configuration
3. **Template Errors**: Ensure all templates exist in `templates/` directory
4. **Permission Issues**: Check file permissions for database and static files

### Database Recovery
```bash
# Backup current database
cp admin_panel.db admin_panel.db.backup

# Reinitialize if corrupted
python database.py
```
